The transfer matrix model code for Fig. S4 in the supplementary information of https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02366
(Field-based design of a resonant dielectric antenna for coherent spin-photon interface)

The TMM_code.m is the core code and the other .m files are the look-up table.

You can check the principle in the Arxiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02366
